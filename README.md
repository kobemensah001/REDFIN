**Train, deploy and monitor a XGBoost regression model with the Amazon SageMaker on REDFIN Dataset**

The notebook outlines the process of model monitoring and endpoint invocation using AWS SageMaker for a Redfin housing model. It includes setting up the environment, organizing imports, creating common objects like S3 buckets, and preparing the dataset for training, validation, and testing. The model is trained using XGBoost, and various hyperparameters are set for the training process. After training, the model is deployed with specified instance details, and a data capture configuration is enabled for capturing inference requests and responses. Data Quality and Model Quality monitors are set up for continuous monitoring of the model's performance, with detailed steps for creating baselines, suggesting baselines, and scheduling monitoring jobs.

The notebook details the setup and configuration of **Data Quality and Model Quality** monitors for a Redfin housing model using AWS SageMaker. Both monitors are scheduled to run at specified intervals, with the schedule details outlined as follows:

**Data Quality Monitor:**
•	ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Data Quality monitoring schedule is specified, indicating the unique identifier in AWS.
•	Name: The schedule is named dq-mon-sch-redfin-xgboost-housing-monitor-alert, signifying its purpose for monitoring data quality specifically for the Redfin housing model.
•	Status: The schedule is currently set to Scheduled, indicating that it is active and will execute according to the defined schedule.
•	Type: The monitoring type is DataQuality, focusing on ensuring the integrity and quality of the data used by the model.
•	Schedule Expression: The schedule is set to run every hour (cron(0 * ? * * *)), providing regular checks on data quality.
•	Job Definition Name: The job definition data-quality-job-definition-2024-03-03-16-28-46-567 is used for the monitoring tasks, likely specifying the parameters and resources for the data quality checks.
•	Endpoint: The monitored endpoint is named endpt-redfin-xgboost-housing-monitor-alert, where the model is deployed and serving predictions.


**Model Quality Monitor:**
•	ARN: Similar to the Data Quality monitor, a unique ARN is provided for the Model Quality monitoring schedule.
•	Name: The schedule is named mq-mon-sch-redfin-xgboost-housing-monitor-alert, indicating its role in monitoring the model's quality.
•	Status: Also set to Scheduled, this schedule is active and will run at specified intervals to check the model's performance and quality.
•	Type: The monitoring type here is ModelQuality, which focuses on the performance metrics of the model, such as accuracy, to ensure it meets the required standards.
•	Schedule Expression: Like the Data Quality monitor, this schedule runs every hour, allowing for frequent assessments of the model's quality.
•	Job Definition Name: The job definition model-quality-job-definition-2024-03-03-16-29-00-573 likely specifies the metrics and thresholds for evaluating model quality.
•	Endpoint: It monitors the same endpoint as the Data Quality schedule, endpt-redfin-xgboost-housing-monitor-alert, ensuring the model's predictions remain accurate and reliable.

**Data Quality Statistics**

The Data Quality Monitor statistics and constraints for the Redfin housing model provide insights into the data quality aspects monitored, including completeness and distinctness of data fields, as well as the configuration settings for evaluating these constraints.
**Statistics Summary:**
•	Median Sale Price YoY: This field is of type String with 38,236 present entries and no missing entries. It has a high number of distinct values (41,247), suggesting significant variability in the year-over-year median sale price data.
•	Other fields such as Median List Price, Homes Sold, Homes Sold YoY, New Listings, New Listings YoY, Median DOM, and Parent Metro Region Metro Code are recognized but have their inferred types marked as Unknown, indicating a potential lack of data or that their data types could not be inferred from the available data.
Constraints Summary:
•	Median Sale Price YoY: Shows a completeness score of 1.0, indicating that there are no missing values for this field in the dataset.
•	The rest of the fields (Median List Price, Homes Sold, etc.) have a completeness score of 0.0, which might suggest that these fields are either entirely missing from the dataset or were not evaluated for completeness.
Monitoring Configuration:
•	Evaluation of Constraints: Enabled, ensuring that the specified data quality constraints are actively checked.
•	Metrics Emission: Enabled, allowing the system to emit metrics related to data quality for monitoring and alerting purposes.
•	Data Type and Domain Checks: Thresholds are set to 1.0, indicating stringent requirements for data type consistency and domain content.
•	Distribution Constraints: Comparisons are enabled with a threshold of 0.1, using a robust comparison method. For categorical fields, a drift method (LInfinity) is specified with a categorical comparison threshold of 0.1, indicating sensitivity to changes in the distribution of categorical variables.
This setup ensures rigorous monitoring of data quality, focusing on the completeness of critical fields and the distribution of data values to detect any significant deviations that might affect the model's performance.

**Model Quality Statistics**

The Model Quality Monitor for the Redfin housing model provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance metrics and the constraints set for monitoring model quality:
**Model Quality Statistics:**
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The value is 62,338.89 with a standard deviation of 2,967.03, indicating the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): The value is 105,563,148,530.21 with a standard deviation of 31,773,907,088.79, reflecting the average of the squares of the errors or deviations.
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The value is 324,904.83 with a standard deviation of 54,501.88, providing a measure of the magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values.
•	R-squared (R2): The value is 0.1334 with a standard deviation of 0.2558, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.
Model Quality Constraints:
•	MAE: A threshold is set at 62,338.89, with the comparison operator GreaterThanThreshold, implying that values above this threshold would indicate a decrease in model quality.
•	MSE: A threshold is set at 105,563,148,530.21, with the comparison operator GreaterThanThreshold, indicating that values exceeding this threshold would signal a reduction in model quality.
•	RMSE: A threshold is set at 324,904.83, with the comparison operator GreaterThanThreshold, suggesting that higher values would indicate poorer model performance.
•	R2: A threshold is set at 0.1334, but with the comparison operator LessThanThreshold, indicating that values below this threshold would reflect a decrease in the model's ability to explain the variance in the data.
These statistics and constraints provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, with specific thresholds set to trigger alerts or actions if the model's quality degrades beyond acceptable levels. The use of both absolute and squared error metrics offers a nuanced understanding of the model's prediction accuracy and error distribution, while the R2 value offers insight into the model's explanatory power.
